On most Linux systems, tty devices are used for 
console login and terminal sessions. For example, you can use a 
tty to log in to the system using a text-based login prompt, or to start a 
terminal session where you can enter commands and interact with the system.

# If tty is enabled, this command will list the tty devices on your system
    - ls /dev/tty*

# To disable tty terminal
    # /etc/systemd/logind.conf
