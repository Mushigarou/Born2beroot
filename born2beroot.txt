(useradd is a lazy command)(In linux we create a user and a group)
    # adduser [username] // useradd [username] 

    # cat /etc/passwd (to list users)
    - (if 'x' is mentionned in front of username it means that password is stored at '/etc/shadow' passwords
    - [username]:x:[UID]:[GID]:[home directory]:[bash]
    mfouadi:x:1001:1001:mfouadi42,,,:/home/mfouadi42:/bin/bash (output )
    test:x:1001:1001::/home/test:/bin/sh (output of useradd (doesn't add a home directory 'ls -al /home'), if you want a home directory add -m option)

To add or change password for a user :
    # passwd [username]

to modify something use :
    # usermod [username]
    # usermod [username] --shell /bin/bash (to change sh to bash)
    # usermod -l [new username] [old username]

to swith users :
    # su - (root user) // sudo su - (log as a root without a user)
    # su [username]

To add a user to the sudoers file :
    # [username] ALL = ALL (all commands, or specify by /bin/ls...)

To add a group to the sudoers file :
    # %[groupname] ALL = NOPASSWD:ALL ('%' means a group)

To add a user to a group :
    # usermod -aG [groupname] [username] ('G' option alone, will add the user to that group and eliminate him from any other group. 'a' stands for append)

Remove a user from a group :
    # gpasswd -d [username] [group name] (-d for delete)

Delete a user :
    # userdel [username]

Create a group :
    # groupadd [name of the group]

    # cat /etc/group (list groups)
    # groups (to see in which grp you are)

Delete a group :
    # groupdel [groupname]
