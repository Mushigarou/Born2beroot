Processes : is an instance of a running program (ex. lanching vscode)
    # ps -aux (list all Processes)

daemons (services) : are processes running, but we didn't launch
    # To know if a process is a daemon, look at the last letter
    # ex. 'ssh' ==> 'sshd',  'ntp' ==> 'ntpd'

THE MASTER OF DAEMONS IS : 'systemd' daemon
    # Service manager (systemctl command line)
    # systemd calls daemons 'units'

    # initialization system "init" (Boot==>kernel==>'systemd daemon is the first process to be launched')
    # ps -aux ==> (init is the first process, PID = 1)
    # sudo apt-get install psmisc
    # pstree (shows launched processes listed in a tree)

    # other init systems : appstart, openrc...

*******************************************

To check daemon status :
    # sudo systemctl status [daemon]
    # sudo systemctl is-active [daemon]
    # sudo systemctl is-enabled [daemon]

*******************************************

Stop a daemon :
    # sudo systemctl stop [daemon]

start a daemon :
    # sudo systemctl start [daemon]

restart a daemon :
    # sudo systemctl restart [daemon]

Reload a daemon : (Not all daemons can be reloaded, depends on their configurations)
    # sudo systemctl reload [daemon]
    # sudo systemctl reload-or-start [daemon] (it will reload it, if it can't it will restart it)

*******************************************

Start a service at boot :
    # sudo systemctl enable [service] (it will be enabled next time)

Stop a service at boot : 
    # sudo systemctl disable [daemon]

*******************************************

to see daemons on a system : (parsed, loaded to memory)
    # sudo systemctl list-units -t services (only active daemons) (-t stands for type)
    # sudo systemctl list-units --all (active and inactive daemons)

to list daemons (not parsed, not loaded (ex. nginx)) :
    #  sudo systemctl list-units-files | grep nginx

*******************************************

Systemd logfile :
    # sudo journalctl -xe
