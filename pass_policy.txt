# man pam (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) (basic function for password checks)

# sudo apt install libpam-pwquality

    # 1: cd /etc/login.config (this where you configure you passwd policy)

    # 2: DON'T FORGET `CHAGE` COMMAND :
        # man chage 
        # change -l [user] // to see info
        # chage -M 30 -m 2 -W 7 [user]

# to see daemons and services
    # /etc/pam.d (file is used to specify system-wide defaults 
        for various settings related to user accounts and authentication.)


# On Debian 11, the pam_pwquality module is usually configured through the /etc/pam.d/common-password
    # To set password policies with pam_pwquality, you can add the appropriate configuration options 
    to the 
        /etc/security/pwquality.conf (man pwquality.conf(5)) 
        The configuration options available in pam_pwquality include:

    minlen: Specifies the minimum password length.
    dcredit: Specifies the number of required digits in the password. 
        A positive value means that the password must contain at least the specified number of digits, 
        while a negative value means that the password must contain at least the absolute value of dcredit digits.
    ucredit: Specifies the number of required uppercase letters in the
        password. A positive value means that the password must contain at least 
        the specified number of uppercase letters, while a negative value means that 
        the password must contain at least the absolute value of ucredit uppercase letters.
    lcredit: Specifies the number of required lowercase letters in the password. 
        A positive value means that the password must contain at least the specified number of 
        lowercase letters, while a negative value means that the password must contain at least the absolute 
        value of lcredit lowercase letters.
    ocredit: Specifies the number of required other (non-alphanumeric) characters in the password. 
        A positive value means that the password must contain at least the specified number of other characters, 
        while a negative value means that the password must contain at least the absolute value of ocredit other characters.
    maxrepeat: Specifies the maximum number of consecutive identical characters allowed in the password.
    maxclassrepeat: Specifies the maximum number of characters from the same character class 
        (e.g., digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters) that are allowed to appear consecutively in the password.
    maxsequence: Specifies the maximum length of monotonic character sequences 
        (e.g., abc, def, hij) that are allowed in the password.

#####   dcredit=-1 and dcredit= are exaclty the same, they do the same job cause absolute value of -1 is 1, 
        while dcredit = 0 means that password can contain at 0 or more digits
