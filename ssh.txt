    # which ssh (check if ssh command is installed)
    # ss -tulpn | grep sshd (to check which port ssh is listenning to)
    # systemctl status ssh (check ssh services)

    # install openssh-server package
    # install openssh-client package
    # sudo apt install net-tools (for ifconfig command) or use, 'ip a' command

    # NAT (Network Adress Translation)
    # ip route (command)
