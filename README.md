# Born2beroot :

## TODO List Of This Project :

### OS
- Install Debian or Rocky Linux
- Installing minimum of services (no graphical interface)

##### Rocky
- Don't have to set up KDump, if you installed Rocky
- SELinux must be runing at startup, and you need to adapt its configuration to the project requirements

##### Debian
- Apparmor for Debian must be runing at startup

### Partionning
- create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM. (image p.5)
- differences between aptitude and apt, or what SELinux or AppArmor

### SSH
- SSH service will be runing on port 4141
- Connection with root via ssh should not be possible
- Configure your operating system with the UFW (or firewalld for Rocky)
- Your firewall must be active when you launch your virtual machine.
- leave only port 4242 open.

### Hostname
- The hostname must be the logging ending with 42
- You will have to modify this hostname during your evaluation.

### Users
- a user with your login as username has to be present.
- This user has to belong to the user42 and sudo groups
- During the defense, you will have to create a new user and assign it to a group.

### Sudo
- Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incorrect password.
- A custom message of your choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong password occurs when using sudo
- Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder.
- The TTY mode has to be enabled
- The paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted.
	/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin

### Strong Password Policy.

- Your password has to expire every 30 days.
- The minimum number of days allowed before the modification of a password will be set to 2.
- The user has to receive a warning message 7 days before their password expires.
- Your password must be at least 10 characters long. It must contain an uppercase
	letter, a lowercase letter, and a number. Also, it must not contain more than 3
	consecutive identical characters.
- The password must not include the name of the user.
- The following rule does not apply to the root password: The password must have
	at least 7 characters that are not part of the former password.
- Of course, your root password has to comply with this policy.
- you will have to change all the passwords of the accounts present on the virtual machine,
		including the root account.


### Script Monitoring.sh
- Must be developed in bash
- At server startup, the script will display some information (listed below) on all ter-
	minals every 10 minutes (take a look at wall). The banner is optional. No error must
	be visible.
 
	- The architecture of your operating system and its kernel version.
		 ```
		 uname -mrs
		 ```
	- The number of physical processors, The number of virtual processors.
		 ```
		 lscpu
		 ```
	- The current available RAM on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
		 ```
		 free -m
		 ```
	- The current available memory on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
		 ```
		 df -h
		 ```
	- The current utilization rate of your processors as a percentage.
		 ```
		 top
		 ```
	- The date and time of the last reboot.
		 ```
		 last -x | grep reboot
		 ```
	- Whether LVM is active or not.
		 ```
		 vgdisplay
		 ```
	- The number of active connections.
		 ```
		 netstat -n
		 ```
	- The number of users using the server.
		 ```
		 who
		 ```
	- The IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.
		 ```
		 ip addr
		 ```
	- The number of commands executed with the sudo program.
		grep -c 'sudo' /var/log/sudo.log
	- Take a look at cron.

## BONUS

### Partionning
- Set up partitions correctly so you get a structure (image p.10)
- Set up a functional WordPress
	- lighttpd
	- MariaDB
	- PHP
- Set up a service of your choice (justify your choice)
	- NGINX / Apache2 excluded!
	- To complete bonus part, you may open more ports to suit your needs. Of course, the UFW/Firewalld rules has to be adapted accordingly.
