************** SUDOERS FILE ***************************

# man sudoers

# The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases (basically
     variables) and user specifications (which specify who may run what).
# Syntaxe :
    # username hostlist = (userlist) commandlist
        
        - The 'username' field indicates which user in the system this rule will apply to.
        - The 'hostlist' tells sudo to apply this rule on a list of system hosts that are known to sudo. By default, sudo only recognizes the local machine as its host.
        - The 'userlist' tells sudo which user account the username field can substitute to.
        - The 'commandlist' is a comma separated list that indicates which programs in the system 
            the username can run as that user.

# The first part is the user, the second is the terminal from where the user can use sudo command, 
    the third part is which users he may act as, 
    and the last one, is which commands he may run when using sudo.

# If you want not to be asked for a password use this form:
    # go2linux ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# how to set nano or vim to use with visudo command as default editor.
    # export VISUAL=vim; visudo
    # export VISUAL=nano; visudo

**************** DEFAULTS LOGFILE ***************************
#logfile
    - Path to the sudo log file (not the syslog log file). 
    - Setting a path turns on logging to a file; 
    - negating this option turns it off. By default, sudo logs via syslog.
