The output is the result of running the ip a command, which displays the network interfaces and their associated addresses on a system.

The first line, 1: lo:, represents the loopback interface, which is a virtual network interface that is used to communicate with the local host.
   The loopback interface has the address 127.0.0.1, which is a special address that always refers to the local host,
   and the link-local address ::1, which is used for communication within the host.

The second line, 2: enp0s3:, represents a network interface on the system. The interface name, enp0s3, may vary depending on the system 
and the type of interface. The interface has the following addresses:

    10.11.100.63/16: This is an IPv4 address assigned to the interface, which is used for communication over the network. 
    The /16 suffix indicates the subnet mask, which determines the range of addresses that are reachable within the same network. 
    In this case, all addresses in the range 10.11.0.0 to 10.11.255.255 are considered part of the same network.

    fe80::a00:27ff:fe8f:88d2/64: This is an IPv6 link-local address assigned to the interface, which is used for communication within the local network.
    The /64 suffix indicates the prefix length, which determines the range of addresses that are considered part of the same network. In this case, 
    all addresses in the range fe80:: to fe80::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff are considered part of the same network.

The state UP indicates that the interface is up and running, and the mtu 1500 indicates the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the interface, 
which is the maximum size of a packet that can be transmitted over the interface.

The link/ether field shows the MAC address of the interface, which is a unique identifier assigned to the interface hardware. 
The brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff field indicates the broadcast address, which is used to send messages to all hosts on the network.

The valid_lft and preferred_lft fields show the lifetime of the address,
which is the amount of time that the address will remain valid and preferred for use
